<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This webpage is about helping your companies online presence for things ranging anywhere from which social media platform you should be active on to optimizing the resaults of your web page on a search engine.</p>

<p>In this challenge i had to clean up the html and css page as some of the parent and child tags in the html sheet were making the styling in the css sheet more difficult then it needed to be. Meaning there were duplicate styles on the css page that could have been compressed into one section making the sheet more cleaner. I also added and removed some ID and Class tags to make styling more easy and efficient in the css styling sheet. Also added descriptions in the html and css sheet to divide the sections to make the code easier to distinguish from  one another.</p>
